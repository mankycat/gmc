# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Setup Admin User Management Page Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic page component for admin user management, define its route, add necessary navigation links (if applicable), and establish the overall layout including placeholders for the user list and action buttons.
### Details:
Create a new React/Vue/Angular component (e.g., `AdminUserManagementPage`). Define the route in the application's router configuration. Add a link to this page in the admin navigation menu. Structure the page using layout components (e.g., grid, flexbox) to accommodate a title, potential filters/search, a table area for the user list, and buttons for actions like 'Add User'.

## 2. Implement User List Display [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Fetch and display the list of users in a table format within the page structure created in the previous step. Include columns for key user information (e.g., name, email, role, status).
### Details:
Integrate with the backend API endpoint for fetching the list of users. Use a data table component (e.g., Material UI Table, Ant Design Table, or a custom component) to render the user data. Implement basic features like displaying data, handling loading states, and displaying an empty state message if no users are found. Add placeholder columns for future action buttons (edit, delete).

## 3. Implement User Add/Edit/Delete Functionality [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Add forms or modals for creating new users and editing existing users. Implement functionality to trigger user deletion. Integrate these actions with the appropriate backend API endpoints.
### Details:
Create separate components for the 'Add User' form/modal and 'Edit User' form/modal. These forms should include fields for relevant user attributes (name, email, password, role, etc.). Add buttons ('Add User' on the page, 'Edit' and 'Delete' in the user list rows). Implement logic to open the correct form/modal, populate it for editing, handle form submission (including validation), and make API calls for create, update, and delete operations. Handle success and error responses (e.g., showing notifications, refreshing the user list).
