# Task ID: 31
# Title: Optimize and Refine Virtual Machine List, CRUD Operations, and Frontend Layout
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Enhance the Virtual Machine management module by optimizing the list display, perfecting CRUD functionality, and improving the frontend layout for usability and consistency.
# Details:
Review and refactor the Virtual Machine (VM) list component to ensure efficient data loading, sorting, and filtering. Audit and enhance all Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations for VMs, ensuring robust error handling, validation, and user feedback. Redesign the frontend layout for the VM management section to align with modern UI/UX standards, ensuring responsiveness, accessibility, and consistency with the rest of the application. Collaborate with backend developers to address any API performance or data consistency issues uncovered during optimization. Document all changes and update user-facing help or tooltips as needed.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the VM list loads efficiently with large datasets, supports sorting and filtering, and displays all relevant VM attributes. Test all CRUD operations for VMs, including edge cases and error scenarios, ensuring proper validation and user notifications. Conduct UI/UX reviews to confirm layout improvements, responsiveness, and accessibility compliance. Perform cross-browser and device testing. Solicit feedback from stakeholders or end users, and confirm that all acceptance criteria are met before closing the task.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Optimize VM List Component Performance [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Refactor the Virtual Machine list component to improve data loading, implement efficient sorting and filtering mechanisms, and reduce rendering time.
### Details:
Implement lazy loading for VM data to reduce initial load time. Add server-side pagination to handle large datasets. Optimize sorting algorithms for VM attributes like name, status, and resource usage. Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed VM data. Add performance metrics tracking to measure improvements.

Optimize sorting algorithms for VM attributes like name, status, and resource usage. Implement client-side caching for frequently accessed VM data. Add performance metrics tracking to measure improvements. Key files to modify or create include frontend/src/pages/VmListPage.tsx (for UI and data handling logic) and frontend/src/services/vmApiService.ts (for API calls, caching, and pagination logic). Ensure these files are updated to support efficient data fetching, sorting, filtering, and caching. Test with varying dataset sizes (10, 100, 1000 VMs) to validate performance gains and correct functionality.

## 2. Enhance VM CRUD Operations [done]
### Dependencies: 31.1
### Description: Audit and improve all Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for Virtual Machines with robust error handling, validation, and user feedback mechanisms.
### Details:
Implement comprehensive form validation for VM creation and updates following best practices for VM configuration. Add detailed error handling with user-friendly messages for common VM operation failures. Create confirmation dialogs for destructive operations. Implement progress indicators for long-running operations. Add success notifications with appropriate context.

## 3. Redesign VM Management Frontend Layout [done]
### Dependencies: 31.1
### Description: Revamp the frontend layout for VM management to align with modern UI/UX standards, ensuring responsiveness, accessibility, and visual consistency.
### Details:
Create responsive layouts that work across desktop and mobile devices. Implement consistent spacing, typography, and color schemes matching application design system. Add keyboard navigation support for all VM management functions. Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility. Optimize layout for different VM management workflows based on user research.

Add keyboard navigation support for all VM management functions. Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for accessibility. Optimize layout for different VM management workflows based on user research. Key files to modify or create include frontend/src/pages/VmListPage.tsx for the main VM listing and management interface, and frontend/src/components/VmCard.tsx for individual VM card components. These files should be updated to support new layout structures, accessibility features, and responsive design patterns. Consider integrating modern UI components such as cards, modals, and action menus for CRUD operations, and ensure all interactive elements are keyboard navigable and screen-reader friendly. Test layouts across multiple screen sizes and devices. Conduct accessibility audit using automated tools and manual testing. Gather user feedback on the new design through usability testing.

## 4. Optimize Backend API Integration [done]
### Dependencies: 31.2
### Description: Collaborate with backend developers to address API performance issues, improve data consistency, and optimize VM data retrieval and manipulation.
### Details:
Identify and resolve bottlenecks in VM data retrieval. Implement efficient data transfer formats to reduce payload size. Establish consistent error handling patterns between frontend and backend. Create or update API documentation for VM endpoints. Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures in VM operations.

Identify and resolve bottlenecks in VM data retrieval by reviewing and optimizing backend/src/services/virtualMachineService.js and backend/src/repositories/virtualMachineRepository.js. Implement efficient data transfer formats (such as selective property fetching and pagination) to reduce payload size and improve response times. Establish consistent error handling patterns between frontend and backend, ensuring clear error codes and messages are returned. Create or update API documentation for VM endpoints, including request/response examples and rate limits. Implement retry mechanisms for transient failures in VM operations, such as network timeouts or rate limit errors. Measure API response times before and after optimization, and test concurrent API requests to ensure stability. Verify error handling works consistently across all VM operations.
