# Title: Implement User Account Login
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user account login functionality.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Login Form UI and Submission Handling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create or update the user interface to include input fields for username/email and password, a submit button, and basic client-side validation (e.g., required fields). Implement the event handler for form submission to collect the input and send it to the backend login endpoint.
### Details:
Use the chosen frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue, Angular) or plain HTML/JS to build the form. Ensure inputs have appropriate types (text/email, password). Use fetch API or a library like Axios to send a POST request to the planned backend login endpoint with the collected credentials.

## 2. Implement Backend Authentication Endpoint and Logic [done]
### Dependencies: 16.1
### Description: Create a backend API endpoint (e.g., `/api/login`) that receives the username/email and password from the client. Implement the logic to query the database for a user matching the provided username/email. Securely compare the provided password with the stored hashed password. Return a success or failure response.
### Details:
Use the chosen backend framework (e.g., Node.js/Express, Python/Flask/Django). Implement the endpoint to handle POST requests. Use a secure password hashing library (e.g., bcrypt) for comparison. Query the user database. Return appropriate HTTP status codes (e.g., 200 for success, 401 for unauthorized) and a JSON body indicating success or failure.

## 3. Implement Session/Token Creation and Response [done]
### Dependencies: 16.2
### Description: Modify the backend authentication logic (implemented in Subtask 2) to, upon successful authentication, generate a secure session ID or JWT (JSON Web Token). Include this session ID or token in the success response sent back to the client (e.g., via cookie or response body).
### Details:
Choose between server-side sessions (using a library like `express-session`) or JWTs (using a library like `jsonwebtoken`). If using sessions, store the session on the server and send the session ID cookie. If using JWTs, sign the token with a secure secret and include it in the response body or a cookie. Ensure appropriate security settings (e.g., httpOnly cookies, token expiration).
