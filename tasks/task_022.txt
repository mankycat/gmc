# Task ID: 22
# Title: Review Implementation vs. README.md for Discrepancies
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Review the current project implementation and compare it against the original README.md to identify any discrepancies, particularly regarding startup procedures and necessary configurations.
# Details:
Perform a detailed comparison between the current state of the project's codebase and the instructions/descriptions provided in the original README.md file. Focus specifically on:

1.  **Startup Procedures:** Verify if the steps outlined in the README for building, running, and starting the application (both frontend and backend, if applicable) are still accurate and complete.
2.  **Dependencies:** Check if the required dependencies listed in the README match the actual dependencies used in the project (e.g., package.json, requirements.txt, etc.).
3.  **Configuration:** Compare configuration instructions or examples in the README with the current configuration methods and requirements.
4.  **Key Features/Architecture:** Briefly review if the high-level description of features or architecture in the README still aligns with the implemented system.

Document all identified discrepancies clearly, noting the section in the README and the corresponding part of the current implementation that differs. Propose necessary updates to the README or potential code adjustments if the README is deemed correct and the code is outdated.

# Test Strategy:
Verification involves reviewing the documented findings. The task is considered complete when:

1.  A comprehensive list of discrepancies between the current implementation and the original README.md has been compiled.
2.  Each discrepancy is clearly described, referencing the relevant sections of both the README and the code/configuration.
3.  Potential actions (e.g., update README, update code) are suggested for each discrepancy.
4.  The reviewer confirms that all major sections of the README relevant to setup, dependencies, and startup have been thoroughly checked against the current codebase.
