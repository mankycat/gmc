# Subtasks:
## 1. Improve User List Table Layout and Styling [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Redesign and implement the layout and styling for the table or list view displaying existing admin users. Focus on readability, column structure, basic sorting/filtering UI elements (if applicable), and pagination UI.
### Details:
Update the HTML/component structure for the user list table. Apply CSS/styling to improve visual appearance, spacing, and alignment. Ensure key user information (e.g., username, email, roles, status) is clearly displayed. Consider responsive table design principles.

## 2. Design and Implement 'Add User' Button and Entry Point UI [done]
### Dependencies: 29.1
### Description: Design and implement the UI element (button or link) to initiate the 'Add User' process. Define and implement the initial state of the add user interface, such as a modal, a slide-out panel, or a dedicated form section.
### Details:
Add a prominent 'Add User' button to the page, typically above or near the user list. Implement the mechanism to trigger the add user form display (e.g., toggle a modal component, navigate to a new route, or reveal an inline form area). Style the button and the container for the add user form.

## 3. Implement Add User Form Fields and Basic Validation UI [done]
### Dependencies: 29.2
### Description: Build the user interface for the 'Add User' form itself. Include necessary input fields (e.g., username, email, password, role selection). Implement basic client-side validation UI feedback (e.g., highlighting required fields, showing format errors).
### Details:
Add input elements (text fields, dropdowns, checkboxes) within the add user interface container defined in subtask 2. Label fields clearly. Implement visual cues for required fields and display error messages or styling for invalid input based on client-side checks (e.g., email format, password strength requirements). Include Save/Submit and Cancel buttons.

## 4. Refine Overall Page Layout, Responsiveness, and UI/UX Flow [done]
### Dependencies: 29.3
### Description: Review the complete Admin Users page with the list and add user components integrated. Make final adjustments to the overall page layout, spacing, and alignment. Ensure responsiveness across various devices. Refine the UI/UX flow for adding a user, including success/error feedback display.
### Details:
Adjust margins, padding, and component positioning for optimal layout. Use CSS media queries or responsive design frameworks to ensure the page is usable on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones. Implement UI feedback for form submission (e.g., loading state, success message on successful add, error message on failure). Ensure smooth transitions or interactions between the list view and the add user form.
