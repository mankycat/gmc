# Task ID: 27
# Title: Implement User Logout Functionality
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement both frontend and backend logic to allow users to securely log out of the application, invalidating their session or token.
# Details:
Frontend Implementation:
- Add a 'Logout' button or link, typically in a navigation bar or user profile menu.
- On click, trigger an action that communicates with the backend logout endpoint.
- Clear any client-side stored authentication data (e.g., tokens in local storage, session cookies).
- Redirect the user to the login page or homepage after successful logout.
- Handle potential errors during the logout process (e.g., network issues, backend errors).

Backend Implementation:
- Create a dedicated API endpoint for logout (e.g., POST /api/auth/logout).
- This endpoint should receive the logout request, typically including the user's authentication token or session identifier.
- Invalidate the user's session on the server-side or blacklist/revoke the authentication token.
- Ensure the endpoint is protected against CSRF attacks if using cookie-based sessions.
- Return a success response (e.g., 200 OK) upon successful logout.
- Do not require authentication for the logout endpoint itself, but the logic within should handle requests from both authenticated and potentially unauthenticated users gracefully (though only authenticated users can truly 'log out').

Considerations:
- How is authentication managed (sessions, JWT, etc.)? The logout logic must align with the chosen method.
- Ensure that simply deleting client-side data is not sufficient; server-side invalidation is crucial for security.
- Provide clear user feedback upon successful logout.

# Test Strategy:
1. Manual Testing:
- Log in with a valid user account.
- Locate and click the 'Logout' button/link.
- Verify that the user is redirected to the login page or homepage.
- Attempt to access a protected page (e.g., dashboard, user profile) directly via URL after logging out. Verify that the user is denied access and potentially redirected back to the login page.
- Check browser storage (local storage, cookies) to ensure authentication tokens/session identifiers have been removed or invalidated client-side.

2. API Testing:
- Use a tool like Postman or curl to send a logout request to the backend endpoint with a valid token/session.
- Verify that the backend returns a success status code (e.g., 200 OK).
- After the logout request, attempt to use the same token/session to access a protected API endpoint. Verify that the request is rejected with an appropriate error (e.g., 401 Unauthorized, 403 Forbidden).
- Test sending a logout request without a token/session or with an invalid one. Verify the backend handles this gracefully (e.g., returns 200 OK or a specific error indicating no active session).

3. Automated Testing:
- Write end-to-end tests using a framework like Cypress or Selenium to simulate user login, navigation to a protected page, clicking logout, and verifying redirection and inability to access protected pages.
- Write backend integration tests to verify the logout endpoint correctly invalidates sessions/tokens and rejects subsequent requests with the invalidated credentials.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Backend: Create Logout Endpoint and Invalidation Logic [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the server-side API endpoint for logout. This involves defining the route, receiving the request (potentially with a token/session identifier), and implementing the core logic to invalidate the user's session or revoke their authentication token in the backend system.
### Details:
Define the endpoint (e.g., `POST /api/auth/logout`). Implement logic based on the authentication method (e.g., destroy session, mark JWT as invalid/blacklisted). Return a basic success response (e.g., 200 OK). Ensure this endpoint does not require prior authentication to be *called*, but the internal logic should handle the presence or absence of a valid session/token.

## 2. Backend: Secure and Refine Logout Endpoint [done]
### Dependencies: 27.1
### Description: Enhance the backend logout endpoint with security measures and handle different request scenarios. This includes adding CSRF protection if using cookie-based sessions and gracefully handling requests from users who are already logged out or provide invalid credentials.
### Details:
If using cookies, implement CSRF protection (e.g., check CSRF token). Add logic to check if the user is currently authenticated before attempting to log out, although the endpoint should still return a success status (200 OK) even if the user wasn't authenticated, as the desired state (logged out) is achieved. Ensure proper logging for logout attempts.

## 3. Frontend: Add Logout UI Element [done]
### Dependencies: 27.2
### Description: Add a visible user interface element (button or link) that users can click to initiate the logout process. This element should be placed in an appropriate location, such as a navigation bar, user profile dropdown, or settings page.
### Details:
Implement the UI component (e.g., `<button>` or `<a>`). Style it appropriately according to the application's design system. Ensure it's conditionally rendered and only visible when a user is authenticated.

## 4. Frontend: Implement Logout Action and Backend Call [done]
### Dependencies: 27.3
### Description: Implement the client-side JavaScript logic that is triggered when the logout UI element is clicked. This logic should make an asynchronous call (e.g., using Fetch API or Axios) to the backend logout endpoint created in previous steps.
### Details:
Add an event listener to the logout element. Inside the listener, prevent the default action (if it's a link). Make a `POST` request to the backend logout endpoint (`/api/auth/logout`). Handle the promise/callback for the request, specifically looking for a successful response status (e.g., 200 OK).

## 5. Frontend: Implement Client-side Cleanup and Redirection [done]
### Dependencies: 27.4
### Description: Complete the frontend logout process by clearing any authentication data stored client-side (e.g., tokens in local storage, cookies) and redirecting the user to a post-logout page, typically the login page or homepage. Also, provide user feedback (e.g., a success message) and handle errors.
### Details:
After receiving a successful response from the backend logout endpoint in the logic from subtask 4, remove authentication tokens from `localStorage` or `sessionStorage`. Clear any relevant cookies that store authentication state. Use `window.location.replace()` or a routing library's navigation function to redirect the user to the login page or homepage. Implement error handling for the backend call (e.g., display a temporary error message to the user if the logout request fails).
