# Title: Implement Frontend and Backend Integration for User Management
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Create frontend API service for User Management and integrate it with the backend API endpoints.
# Details:


# Test Strategy:


# Subtasks:
## 1. Define and Implement Frontend User Management API Service Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the basic structure and interface for the frontend service responsible for interacting with the backend User Management API. Define methods for common operations (e.g., getUsers, createUser, updateUser, deleteUser) without implementing the actual HTTP calls yet. This service will act as a wrapper around backend API interactions.
### Details:
Create a new service file (e.g., `userService.js` or `userService.ts`). Define an object or class with methods corresponding to user management operations. Use promises or async/await for method return types. Initially, these methods can return mock data or simply log calls to verify the structure.

## 2. Implement Backend API Calls in Frontend User Management Service [done]
### Dependencies: 30.1
### Description: Add the actual logic to the frontend user management service methods to make HTTP requests to the corresponding backend API endpoints. This involves using a frontend HTTP client (like Axios, Fetch API, etc.) to send requests and handle responses.
### Details:
Modify the methods defined in Subtask 1. Use the chosen HTTP client to make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE requests to the backend User Management endpoints. Configure request headers (e.g., Content-Type, Authorization), include request bodies for create/update operations, and handle response data and potential errors. Ensure correct mapping of frontend method parameters to backend request parameters/bodies.

## 3. Integrate Frontend User Management Service into UI Components [done]
### Dependencies: 30.2
### Description: Use the implemented frontend user management service (from Subtask 2) within the relevant frontend UI components that require user management functionality (e.g., a user list page, a user detail form, a user creation modal).
### Details:
Import the user management service into the necessary components. Call the service methods based on user interactions (button clicks, form submissions) or component lifecycle events (component mount for fetching data). Handle loading states, display data returned by the service, and manage errors. Update UI based on successful operations (e.g., refresh list after deletion).
